  # this config forces an error to be thrown! This is to make
  # sure that we don't encounter errors when updating old configs.

# CUSTOM DEFAULTS SPECIALIZATION
# - This key is deleted on load and the correct key on the root config is set similar to defaults.
# - Unfortunately this hack needs to exists as hydra does not yet support this kinda of variable interpolation in defaults.
# specializations:
  # _dataset_sampler_: ${dataset.data_type}__${framework.data_sample_mode}

  # newer samplers -- only active for frameworks that require 3 observations, otherwise random for 2, and exact for 1
  # _dataset_sampler_: gt_dist__${framework.data_sample_mode}

  # random samplers -- force random sampling of observation pairs or triples
  # _dataset_sampler_: random__${framework.data_sample_mode}
